# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) -  Course Repository

 Official GitHub repository for the **Introduction to Natural Language Processing** course taught during the Spring Semester at the **Department Of Informatics - University of Piraeus,Greece**. This course offers a hands-on and theoretical dive into modern NLP techniques, tools, and applications — **from foundational linguistics to deep learning and large language models**.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course covers a broad spectrum of NLP, starting from classical formalisms (e.g., Chomsky grammars and parsing) to cutting-edge models like BERT, T5, and GPT. Throughout, we balance theoretical concepts with python implementations.
